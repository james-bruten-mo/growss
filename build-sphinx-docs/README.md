# Build Sphinx documentation workflow

This reusable workflow enables developers to build and upload Sphinx-generated
documentation from a local repository to GitHub Pages.

## Usage

To use this workflow developers must have a `requirements.txt` file to define
the sphinx dependencies that will be used by the `build-sphinx-docs` workflow.
By default the workflow will look for a `requirements.txt` file in the top level
of the calling project repository. An example of a `requirements.txt` file which
could run this workflow would be as follows:

### Example requirements

```text
sphinx==8.2.3
pydata-sphinx-theme==0.16.1
sphinx-design==0.6.1
sphinx-copybutton==0.5.2
sphinx-lint==1.0.0
sphinx-sitemap==2.8.0
sphinxcontrib-svg2pdfconverter==1.3.0
```

In this example file both the package name and version numbers of these packages
have been specified. This workflow would still run if only the package names
were specified and would by default install the most recent version of each
package. However, it is recommended that version numbers are used in the
`requirements.txt` file to ensure consistency across builds and to avoid
automatic updates to packages breaking the workflow.

To call this reusable workflow from a project repository a local workflow stored
in the `.github/workflows` directory of the form described below is required:

### Build Sphinx Documentation

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Build Sphinx Documentation
    uses: MetOffice/growss/.github/workflows/build-sphinx-docs.yaml@main

    with:
      docs-directory: Directory containing the documentation source
      requirements: Path to the requirements file to install dependencies from
      sphinx-opts: Additional options to pass to the Sphinx build command
      build-directory: Directory to output the html documentation to
      runner: The runner to use for the job (ubuntu-latest)
      timeout: Timeout for the job in minutes (5)
```

Here the user would implement this file and replace each of the parameters with
the respective data types as dictated by the inputs section of the
`build-sphinx-docs.yaml` file.

Following the calling of the `build-sphinx-docs` workflow, the
`deploy-sphinx-docs` workflow can be used to deploy the generated html
documentation to the GitHub webserver. This workflow can be called from a
workflow using the form describe below:

### Deploy built HTML to GitHub Pages

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Publish Documentation
    uses: MetOffice/growss/.github/workflows/deploy-sphinx-docs.yaml@main

    with:
      runner: The runner to use for the job (ubuntu-latest)
      timeout: Timeout for the job in minutes (5)
```

Both of these steps can be combined to produce a simple build and deploy
documentation pipeline for a repository:

### Example continuous integration pipeline in an external repository

An example workflow to build Sphinx documentation and deploy it to GitHub Pages
when changes are pushed to the `main` branch:

```yaml
name: Build and Publish Docs

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build-docs:
    name: Build sphinx docs
    uses: MetOffice/growss/.github/workflows/build-sphinx-docs.yaml@main
    with:
      requirements: /path/to/requirements.txt
      runner: ubuntu-24.04
      timeout: 10
      docs-directory: "/path/to/documentation"
      sphinx-opts: "extra options"
      build-directory: "/path/to/build/html"

  deploy-docs:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    needs: build-docs
    name: Deploy GitHub pages
    uses: MetOffice/growss/.github/workflows/deploy-sphinx-docs.yaml@main
    with:
      runner: ubuntu-24.04
      timeout: 5
```
